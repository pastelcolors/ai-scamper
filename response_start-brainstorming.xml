    To generate a useful and relevant set of AI-powered brainstorming suggestions for the user's problem and goal, I will leverage the SCAMPER framework to craft thought-provoking questions that can help the user explore different angles and make new connections. I will aim to provide a diverse set of suggestions that cover various aspects of the problem space, while also grounding them in the specific context provided.

The key steps I will take are:

1. Analyze the user's problem, goal, and context to understand the core challenge they are trying to solve and the parameters they need to consider.
2. Generate AI questions based on the SCAMPER themes (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Rearrange) that can help the user approach the problem from different perspectives.
3. Craft the AI questions to be open-ended and encourage the user to explore new ideas, make connections, and challenge assumptions.
4. Provide expert opinions and insights in the section content to give the user additional context and thought starters.
5. Organize the suggestions into a visual mind map-like structure to make it easy for the user to navigate and explore the AI-generated ideas.
