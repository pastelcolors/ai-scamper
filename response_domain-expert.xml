<thoughts>As the CEO, I see the potential for allowing image input as a prompt to unlock new creative possibilities for your AI-powered brainstorming tool. This feature could enable users to leverage visual cues and associations to inspire more diverse and innovative ideas. However, we'll need to carefully consider the technical and user experience challenges this may present, such as ensuring the AI can accurately interpret and respond to a wide range of image inputs. Additionally, we'll need to explore how this feature could be integrated into our overall business strategy and marketing efforts to drive user adoption and engagement.</thoughts>
